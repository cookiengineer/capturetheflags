# Keygen Me

Never use static hashes


# Problem

The License Verification Method of a sample program is very
unsecure and uses prefixes and suffixes, with a static user
hash in order to validate whether or not the license is valid.


# Solution

I wrote a simple `keygen.mjs` file that recreates the expected
values similar to how the sample program expected it.

It's pretty easy to do so, because the code of the sample
program is easy to understand and not really obfuscated.
