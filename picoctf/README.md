# Write-Ups for picoCTF Challenges

This folder contains my write-ups and notes for the picoCTF
challenges.

The `challenge` folder always contains a `download.sh` that
gets the source codes for local debugging and analysis.

In the `solution` folder there's usually the source codes
that try to automate the decoding/reverse engineering process,
with all shell scripts and commands that were used in the
process.


## Unsolved Challenges
