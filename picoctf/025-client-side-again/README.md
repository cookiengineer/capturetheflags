# Client-Side Again


# Problem

The code does client-side validation, and tries to obfuscate
it a little by using comparisons that don't actually matter.

This is strictly a code reverse-engineering challenge, and
the idea is to learn JavaScript code and how it works.

It's pretty easy, actually. The added obfuscation was just
there to rotate around the DICTIONARY a little, but that's
pretty much it.


# Solution

This is a manual process, so it needs some beautification
of the JS code. I used `js-beautify` to get started and
went from there.
